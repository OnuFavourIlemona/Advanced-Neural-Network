# Advanced-Neural-Network
A machine learning system that emulates the concept of nuclear fission by creating a parent neural network that dynamically spawns child neural networks in a tree-like structure. Each child network adapts to new data distributions, improving the system's ability to handle evolving/diverse datasets. Aims at scalability and knowledge transfer in NN.
